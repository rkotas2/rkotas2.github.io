<h2>About Me</h2>
<font size="3">
  <p>My name is Rachel Kotas and I have been dancing for 15 years in Rochester, NY. I started out at a local dance studio, A Time For Dance, where I discovered my love for dance and also realized that I wanted more. At age 8, I decided to switch studios to attend The Rochester City Ballet. I was in two performances of The Nutcracker where I was a Holly Sprite and an Angel. In 2009, I decided to go back to A Time For Dance for a few classes while starting at a competitive studio, Rising Talents. I attended two studios all through high school up until college. I auditioned for UB’s dance program during my senior year of high school and successfully got in and here I am!</p>

<p>Currently, I attend the University at Buffalo for dance and business. I thought this was the most appropriate choice for me.</p>
