<h2>About Me</h2>
<font size="3">
  <p>My name is Rachel Kotas and I have been dancing for 15 years in Rochester, NY. I started out at a local dance studio, A Time For Dance, where I discovered my love for dance and also realized that I wanted more out of dance. At age 8, I decided to switch studios to attend The Rochester City Ballet. I was in two performances of The Nutcracker where I was a Holly Sprite and an Angel. In 2009, I decided to go back to A Time For Dance for a few classes while starting at a competitive studio, Rising Talents. I attended those two studios all through high school and up until college. I auditioned for the University at Buffalo’s dance program during my senior year of high school, successfully got in, and here I am!

<p>I have studied various styles of dance including ballet, tap, jazz, modern, lyrical, contemporary and pointe. However, I am most interested in ballet and pointe. I have been fortunate to take class under so many different choreographers and teachers throughout my dance career that have each given me something different. I think it is crucial to a dancer’s life that they have the opportunity to study under multiple teachers since it gives a holistic sense to the dancer’s career.

<p>
Currently, I attend the University at Buffalo for dance and business. I thought this was the most appropriate choice for me. I chose to major in dance because I simply could not imagine my life without dancing. I chose business as my second major since it will give me so many possibilities in life. By receiving a dual degree, I have the option to combine the two and open my own dance studio. If my interests change, I can always take the two degrees in separate directions.

As of right now, at the end of my first semester as a freshman, I know that the University at Buffalo is where I belong. I am learning so much and pushing myself harder than I ever thought I could. I am very excited to see where my future will take me!
